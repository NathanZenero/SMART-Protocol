# SMART-Protocol
JSON Schema for Interchange of Oil Well Drilling Program Information
Unless othewise specified in specific code, everything in this covered under GNU GPL v3.0

Some Basic Rules for Contributors

1. Attempt to use data structures that reflect third-normal concepts
   a. Use general concepts, not specific
   b. break data structures into small, modular components
   c. use the simplest relationships possible
   d. avoid overly long tables
3. Use plain English.  Avoid using abbreviations or jargon that make it difficult for non-experts to read and understand
4. Use PPDM definitions and concepts when appropriate but recongnize that some of these are not well defined
5. When in doubt, say less
6. Don't boil the ocean
   a. break the work into 2-4 week chunks
   b. iterate, test, and iterate as quickly as possible
7. Flexibility WINS
   a. every user or organization should be able to use this schema with their existing applications
   b. users and organization will used mixed units and will make changes on-the-fly.  We will support that because the business demands it.
8. No Self-Imposed Roadblocks
   a. No NDAs
   b. No lawyers
   c. No industry organizations
   d. contribute as you wish, come and go as you please, use professional standards.

Goals of this project are:
1. make sharing of the drilling program seamless, painless, and effortless
2. minimize the amount of change (ideally zero) for users to digitize and share drilling programs
3. fast track concepts that will eventually lead to standards but not focus on standard writing
4. encourage users to include much more rigourous data into a drilling program
